## Warnings
This pack is currently only works for version **1.21.10**! It will not work on any other version. 

Before you install, be warned that Limbo is firstly *unforgiving* and secondly *laggy*. Baby's first worldgen project and it shows. Oberer especially takes a while to generate unless you have a beast of a PC. If you want to pre-generate your chunks using the Chunky mod, I'd recommend starting the loading after someone gets banished to Limbo, since the spot the player spawns at could be 100,000 blocks from (0,0) in any given direction.  
I can already hear the worldgen tryhards laughing in the distance.

## Installation
1. At the top left of the page should be a nice green button reading **Code**. Click it, then click **Download ZIP**.  
2. Make a world and open the datapacks folder in that world. Drop the zip file inside. If you have some issues getting the pack to work, unzip it into the datapacks folder make sure the `pack.mcmeta` is at, `your-world-save/datapacks/abgrund-main/pack.mcmeta`. If you're still having issues getting it installed, search up a youtube tutorial about how to install a datapack. Don't ask for help in the comments; you won't get any.

## notes
If there are any bugs, report them here.

This was originally developped on and balanced for a 1.21.4 server that had a lot of mods (one of which being Enchancement) and then quickly updated for my video. I did test it; it's playable although it's a much different experience without Enchancement.

I was too lazy to make a Modrinth page.

for you peep digging through the code, 4864770 = ABGRUND
