### Essence of Abgrund
- Method for unbanished players to transfer into Limbo.

# Mechanics
### Getting into Limbo
- Two methods.
  - You can die and get banished to Limbo (which you will have to do anyway if you want to go)
  - You can use Essence of Abgrund, which is only obtainable once you have visited Limbo.
### Getting banished to Limbo
- Every time you die, you have a chance to be banished to Limbo.
  - Can be disabled in config
  - This chance increases as difficulty increases
  - If Hardcore mode is enabled, the chance is 100%.
- If you die whilst banished, you will respawn in Limbo
  - If Hardcore mode is enabled, you don't respawn. If you manage to escape Limbo and unbanish yourself, you still won't be able to respawn. You get one extra life.
### Getting into Limbo without being banished
- Once you use an Essence of Abgrund, you can willingly teleport into Limbo without being banished. In this case, if you die, you will simply respawn (unless you're in Hardcore) outside of Limbo.
- You will also keep all of your items.
- Note that this is a one-way trip. The only way to escape Limbo would be through death or the normal method.
